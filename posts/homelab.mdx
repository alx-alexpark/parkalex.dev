# Introduction
A homelab is a word meaning a server or servers that are used for personal use. This can be anything from a simple raspberry pi to a full-blown home datacenter. 

## Why?
I mostly decided to undergo this endeavor because I wanted to gain valuable experience regarding system administration. I also wanted to use this server to host personal infrastructure, such as hosting files and storing backups. 
Most importantly, I wanted to have a fun experience doing something I enjoy.

# Initial setup
I came home from school to the huge 50-pound server in a box. I first moved it to the room it would be situated in, and opened the box.
I didn't have a rack, so I just placed the server on the ground, on top of the styrofoam it came in. The server only had a VGA video output, so I had to use an ancient VGA projector to see its video output.
Before I could install an os, I had to flash the RAID controller into LSI IT/HBA mode. This is because the RAID card in its current state can only do hardware RAID. Since hardware raid is not very relevant nowadays, I wanted to use ZFS instead, requiring me to crossflash the card.
There is a very nice guide on [Fohdeesha.com](https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html) that I followed to crossflash the card. An hour later, I was ready to install [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve). Due to having a very jank projector setup, I couldn't install [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) using the installer, and therefore had to resort to installing debian, and then installing [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) from there.
After I got [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) installed, I had to connect the server to my home network, which was harder and sketchier than it needed to be. I ended up combining 2 ethernet cables and routing cables in weird places through my house until I reached my router. After all this, it was getting late and I had school the next day, so I decided to continue tomorrow.

# VM setup
I intended from the very start to keep the host OS practically untouched. Everything that ran on my server was to run in a VM. I did this mostly due to security reasons, and the ease of being able to backup and restore VMs. I decided to make a VM for services exposed to the internet, and another for services kept private to my local network. I also had a VM that acted as a subnet router for [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).
Since I did not want to install Debian on every VM, I made a VM into a Template and then cloned it for each VM I wanted to make. This made it very easy to create new VMs.

## Internet facing VM (RedVM)
On my internet facing VM that runs exposed infrastructure, the first thing I did was to add some firewall rules to isolate it from my LAN. I did this because I did not want any possible hackers to be able to attack other computers on my home network. Since I love Docker and use it for everything, I picked Traefik as my reverse proxy/web server, due to first-class Docker support.
It's a very nice webserver, and is easy to use. It also has nice features such as automatic TLS certificates from LetsEncrypt.

## LAN VM (LocalVM)
This VM hosts services that are only available to my local network, and via [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/). I plan to use this VM to host some sort of file storage (probably Nextcloud), and PhotoPrism. It also runs Pi-hole, a selfhosted DNS server, with the added functionality of being able to block ads and trackers network-wide.
Currently, I don't know what webserver I will be using for this VM, but it will probably be Traefik. I still intend to have HTTPS even on my LAN, so I will either use an external CA with dns-challenges or create my own certificate authority.

## VPN VM (TailscaleVM)
This VM is a very simple VM, that only runs [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/). It is used to connect to my LAN. I chose to use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) because it is very easy to use, and it is very secure. It also has a very nice feature of being able to connect to other [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) nodes, and create a mesh network. This is very useful for when I am on the go and want to connect to my home network.

## Gameserver VM (GamesVM)
I play games occasionally, and I like hosting my own servers for me and my friends. For now, this only runs Minecraft, but in the future, I can see this VM running other games such as Rust, and SCPSL.

# Tech specs
For those of you that are interested, here are the specs of the server, starting with a neofetch!

The server came with 2 x 500GB hard drives, plugged into an H710P Mini, and I also added a 1TB NVMe SSD I had, using a PCIe adaptor card.

# Conclusion
I hope this server becomes a platform for me to learn more about system administration, and have fun. I will be blogging about my experiences with this server, and I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post. If you have any comments or questions, [contact me](/contact)!
